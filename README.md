# dotfiles and more

My dotfiles, os settings, plus many brew + cask packages. Gratefully extended from [webpro's dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles).

It targets OS X systems, but since it has some defensive checks it should work on *nix as well (tested on a few Linux boxes).

## Install

On a sparkling fresh installation of OS X:

    sudo softwareupdate -i -a
    xcode-select --install
    # make sure to change owner of /usr/local to yourself if you hadn't
    sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local

Install the dotfiles with either Git or curl:

### Clone with Git

    git clone https://github.com/morriz/dotfiles.git
    source dotfiles/install.sh

### Remotely install using curl

Alternatively, you can install this into `~/.dotfiles` remotely without Git using curl:

    sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/morriz/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"

Or, using wget:

    sh -c "`wget -O - --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morriz/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"

## The `dotfiles` command

    $ dotfiles help
    Usage: dotfiles <command>

    Commands:
       help               This help message
       edit               Open dotfiles in default editor (subl) and Git GUI (stree)
       test               Run tests
       update             Update packages and pkg managers: OS X Applications, Homebrew/Cask, npm, Ruby, and pip
       osx                Apply OS X system defaults
       dock               Apply OS X Dock settings
       install mjolnir    Install Mjolnir (Homebrew/Luarocks)

## Customize/extend

You can put your custom settings, such as Git credentials in the `system/.custom` file which will be sourced via `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` automatically. This file is in `.gitignore`. Please provide custom git creds, or override mine in git/.gitconfig.

In the `runcom/` folder you can find files that were symlinked into $HOME, and which may also be edited. Depending on your preference for bash vs zsh, you can edit `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`. Shared stuff should go into `runcom/.common`.

Alternatively, you can have an additional, personal dotfiles repo at `~/.extra`.

* `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` will load `runcom/.common`, which sources all `~/.extra/runcom/*.sh` files.
* The installer (`install.sh`) will run `~/.extra/install.sh`.
